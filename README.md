# ItemSense
Intellisense for items!

The aim of this addon is to provide auto-complete functionality for easily typing items into chat that you don't readily have a link to.

Currently you can use

/is

To open up a searchable window of items (if you notice we do not have an item listed, please let us know).

/is <search term>

If you insert a string to search on, the addon will try to print the first found item into your say channel (/s).
